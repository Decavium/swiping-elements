This element will be part of a larger planned project. 
To experience its functions it needs to be used on a device
or in developer mode to emulate touch.

It has the following features:
* It can expand and collapsed with the tap of a finger
* It can be scrolled left and right
* A scroll to the right removes the element
* Holding the element for a second makes it jiggle (hold again to stop)
